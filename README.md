# Queue
iOS app for our 67-442 final project. Restaurant virtual waiting line, powered by proximity beacons (Estimote).

The backend server for this app is located [here](https://github.com/Ligerx/queue-api)

### Mock data from the placeholder json server
__I believe the data is outdated__

mock-data.json

Quick and dirty server to serve up JSON to our app for incremental development steps.
Install json-server to run: npm install -g json-server
Then run: json-server --watch mock-data.json
